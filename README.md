MooTools-DatePicker
===============

Smoothly animating, very configurable and easy to install.
No Ajax, pure Javascript. 4 skins available out of the box.

This is a port of [MonkeyPhysics datepicker](http://www.monkeyphysics.com/mootools/script/2/datepicker) so thank him for the 
this great plugin. Also thanks to MadmanMonty, marfillaster and eerne for their changes

How to use
----------

	#JS
	new DatePicker(input-target-selector [, options-object]);

where the input-target-selector naturally is a MooTools selector (eg. .datepickers or #great_picker). The datepicker will be effective for all selected input elements. Usage examples are given at the bottom of this document.
